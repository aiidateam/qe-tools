# `qe-tools`

Python tools for working with [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/).

>[!WARNING]
> The `qe-tools` is being redesigned significantly for the next major release (v3.0).
> Expect the API on `main` to be _very_ unstable until the alpha release, and even then there could be breaking changes.

## ðŸ“‹ Road map

The basic features we want to offer, in order of priority:

1. Output parsing: see [current design](https://qe-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/outputs/).
1. Interoperability with other tools ([AiiDA](https://aiida.net/), [`pymatgen`](https://pymatgen.org/), [ASE](https://ase-lib.org/), [MaRDA extractors](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors), ...).
1. Input file parsing / generation / validation.
1. Definitions and explanations of failure modes.
1. (tbd) Error handling approaches.
